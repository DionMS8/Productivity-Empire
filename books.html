                    <br>
                    <p>Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for improving every day. James Clear reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviours that lead to remarkable results.</p>
                    <p>If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again, not because you don&#8217;t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.</p>
                    <p>Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits—whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organisation hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.</p>

                    <img class = "center" src = "https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/getting-things-done-productivity-book.jpg" width = 300  height = 300 >
                    <br>
                    <p>This book is something like the modern Bible of productivity books – it appears on every single productivity list and is recommended by many.</p>
                    <p>Allen’s premise is simple (even if the book is not): “our productivity is directly proportional to our ability to relax.” He’s developed a framework that you can customize to your own needs and get all those pesky free-floating to-do’s into one organized system filled with files and action lists.</p>
                    <p>There are dedicated followers of this system (self-named GTDers), but know that this is a complex system requiring a level of self discipline and organization just to get through the book.</p>

                    <p>Part historical commentary on the genius of da Vinci, part productivity book with excellent exercises to boot, this book has a little bit for everybody. You won’t necessarily find accurate or extensive information about da Vinci as a thinker, but you will come away with valuable information.
                    It will also give you new ways to experience the world and think differently all in the name of liberating your “unique intelligence”.</p>
